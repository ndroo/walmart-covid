## You have two ways to run this:

### 1. In your terminal using search.php. To use it this way...

  1.1. Replace the cookie in the search.php file with one from your browser (you'll need to inspect the requests to the walmart API from their website, copy the cookie and then paste it into the code)
  
  1.2. Run: php search.php
  
  1.3. Go book on the walmart website


OR...


### 2. As a website using index.php

I added this option because my fiance wasn't happy about how annoying it was to get the cookie to make the search.php option work, so i automated the whole thing.

This is a rush job, its gross i know, sorry...i've got a real job to do though.
